#### About Danny

Danny is an enthusiastic geologist interested in most facets of geology but is currently working in gold exploration. His PhD (University of Calgary) focused on a basin-scale analysis of the Nanaimo Basin, British Columbia, Canada. This involved integrating traditional sedimentological and stratigraphic methods with geochronology and chronostratigraphic methods to better understand the interplay between orogenesis and basin sedimentation along active margins.

Post-PhD Danny continued to develop his geospatial and data science skills developing new techniques to bring value to stakeholders and companies. New to mineral exploration, Danny has worked previously in the oil and gas industry on exploration and development projects, as well as consulted on numerous other projects wide-ranging in geoscience.

Danny is also an avid rock climber, back-country skier, and mandolin player. Some of that may filter in here as well.
