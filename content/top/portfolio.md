#### Portfolio

This portfolio consists of a range of projects that describes that demonstrate the range of level of my abilities in the following fields:
- Sedimentary geology
- Geospatial analysis, remote sensing, and cartography
- R, RMarkdown, RShiny
- Data science (cleaning through modeling)

##### stRat stat
Graphic logs (i.e., drawn core logs or measured sections) are one of the most commonly used tools to illustrate geologic heterogenity of sedimentary deposits. Although they are very common, they are rarely leveraged for more than visual analysis and description. This project set out to develop an open-source GUI-based software that allows users to digitize then summarize these data for use in exploratory data analysis or modeling.
This project required:
 - Domain expertise
 - Advanced R knowledge, RShiny

##### ASTER sensor workflow
The ASTER sensor on the TERRA satellite is one of the premiere multispectral sensor for mapping geologic bodies. This project focused on creating an object-oriented stack of functions that processed ASTER data from 1LB to top of atmosphere reflectance. Additional functions mask vegetation and snow, create mineral indices, and produce principle component analysis RGB false colour composites.This project required:
 - Advanced R knowledge to create slim functions
 - Ability to learn quickly

##### Upper Nanaimo Group Chronostratigraphy
Deep-water sediment routing systems are more poorly understood compared to other sedimentary systems (e.g., fluvial or aeolian), as they difficult to monitor in the modern and are controlled by a number of upstream and downstream processes. My PhD work focused on deducing the allogenic controls on deep-water channel systems preserved in the upper Nanaimo Group, British Columbia, Canada. This was done by integrating field stratigraphy (field mapping, stratigraphic sections) with U-Pb detrital zircon techniques to constrain the timing of deep-water channel system sedimentation and compare it to the tectonic evolution of the near-by Coast Mountains. 
This project required:
 - Domain expertise of deep-water systems, sedimentary basins, and tectonics.
 - VBA and R to create and visualize numeric models and field data. 
 - Geospatial methods to organize field data and integrate additional datasets (e.g., lidar).
 - Technical writing and presentation skills producing peer-reviewed academic journal articles, industry talks, and academic talks.
 
##### Various RShiny Dashboards and tools
1) Geologic data visualizer
Geologic data can be spatial, temporal, numeric, and categorical. Lastly, it is almost always very messy.
2) Simple stratigraphic forward model of fluvial deposits

These two projects required:
 - Quick learning and ability to "figure it out"
 - Agile framework and ability to pivot on design
