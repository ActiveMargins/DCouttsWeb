## Hello [Blog] World

### Danny Coutts
This blog belongs to me, Danny Coutts. I recently graduated with my PhD geoscience from the University of Calgary. For my PhD, I focused on a basin-scale analysis of the Nanaimo Basin, British Columbia, Canada. This utilized stratigraphic mapping, sedimentological analysis, and detrital zircon techniques. I'm quite often interested in the largest-scale processes (e.g., tectonics) but do enjoy measuing detailed information that helps inform/deduce that larger picture. Outside of my PhD I've worked in the oil and gas industry on both exploration and development projects, as well as in the environmental industry collecting and analyzing groundwater samples.

I often brand myself as a digital geologist. In my definition that is a geologist who aims to bring in numerical and quantitative methods into all aspects of geology. This may be through geospatial analysis (e.g., remote sensing or measures of spatial heterogeneity) or through quantification of traditional datasets (e.g., measured sections/core logs/graphic logs)

Now that I am post-PhD I'm very interested in applying my problem solving skills and domain knowledge to geospatial or geological fields to help develop or implement new techniques to add value to stakeholders and companies.


### Goals of the blog
This blog will hopefully serve as a portfolio, notepad, and/or working folder for ideas. I will be regularly updating it with recent work that is partially finished, discussions of large projects that are already complete, and any some fun stuff I do as well. All words reflect my own views not those of any funding agencies or employers. Lastly, please get in touch if any of the content resonates with you. I'm always happy to chat about geology, geospatial stuff, and most other things.
